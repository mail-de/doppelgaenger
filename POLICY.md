# Engineering Policy

These rules are mandatory for coding changes in this repository.

## Must Rules

- MUST: Keep the project toolchain consistent across module metadata, Docker
  builds, Makefile targets, and documentation.
- MUST: Run `make guardrails` before committing or opening a pull request.
- MUST: Keep `.golangci.yml` aligned with the repository guardrail policy and
  run the full `golangci-lint run ./...` through `make lint` or
  `make guardrails`.
- MUST: Keep `vendor/` synchronized after dependency changes.
- MUST: Run Go tests through the Makefile targets so local validation stays
  consistent with CI and release builds.
- MUST: Add focused regression coverage for bug fixes when a reproducer is
  practical.
- MUST: Write code comments and technical documentation in English.
- MUST: Write commit messages as `Prefix: Concise headline`, using only the
  approved prefixes `Add`, `Change`, `Fix`, `Remove`, `Refactor`, `Test`,
  `Docs`, `Build`, `Ci`, `Vendor`, `Security`, and `Chore`.
- MUST: Use the commit subject as a headline for what was fundamentally done,
  then use the body as a short bullet list of the essential implementation,
  validation, operator-facing, packaging, or dependency details.
- MUST: Split unrelated work into separate commits when no single approved
  prefix and headline describes the change cleanly.

## Definition Of Done

- [ ] Dependency changes were followed by `go mod tidy` and `go mod vendor`.
- [ ] `make guardrails` passes locally.
- [ ] All `golangci-lint` findings are fixed.
- [ ] New or changed code has focused test coverage where appropriate.
- [ ] Comments and technical docs introduced by the change are English-only.
- [ ] Commit messages use the approved prefix, headline, and bullet-list body
      format.
